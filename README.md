# Double Reward

## What
Simple App for Google App Engine that handles a completed item notification via [Todoist webhook](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/#webhooks). It creates a new TODO task in Habitica and automatically completes it.

## Why
Because I prefer Todoist as my day planner and Habitica as a general productivity tool. I'm a big fan of gamification and love to get a reward for task completion. This app allows me to get karma points form Todoist and experience from Habitica.
